# 🧠 Tech Troubleshooting Expert System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Rule-Based Expert System** developed in Python that diagnoses common computer issues based on user-provided symptoms and suggests appropriate solutions.  
It simulates human expert decision-making using logical rules and forward chaining inference.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design an intelligent system that:
- Accepts user symptoms as input
- Applies predefined rules
- Identifies possible problems
- Suggests solutions
- Displays reasoning steps

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Rule-Based Logic
- Forward Chaining Algorithm

---

## 🏗️ System Working
1. User enters symptoms separated by commas.
2. System stores symptoms as **facts**.
3. Rules are checked repeatedly.
4. If conditions match → new fact is generated.
5. Process continues until no new facts can be derived.
6. Final problems and solutions are displayed.
